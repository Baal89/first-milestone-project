## Project's name

This is a static front-end only web site for a band call The Monkees. The band 
is looking for more visibility in order to attract more fans, so they decided to have 
a website.



## UX

The website is for all the Monkees fans and potential fans that want to stay up to date
with their work such as new videos, audios or live concert.
Thanks to it the band want to gain more visibility on the web 
showing all their work and publicise their availability 
to perform at wedding and birthday parties.

4) as a fan I want to follow my favourite band on the new social media they got.

Thanks to Bootstrap I been able to create a fully responsive website.

everything works well.

DevTools of Google it turned out as an incredible help to fix any bug and to check 
the site with different screen size.

## Deployment   

I used the folowing steps to deploy the site:
   1. Initialised the local directory in my project with `git init`.
   2. Added the files in the local repository created with `git add .` .
   3. Commited the files that I have staged in the local repository with `git commit -m`.
   4. I have created an empty repository in Github.
   5. I copied from GitHub the following path and I have run it in the cloud9 terminal `git remote add origin https://github.com/Baal89/first-milestone-project`.
   6. I moved my local repository to GitHub with `git push -u origin master`.
   7. finally I have gone to the settings, I have selected the master branch, I have saved and the website was published.
